#Journal for my thoughts and opinions while working on this project

-Dec 8
Today I did initial setup and configuration. There are lots of security considerations right now that I want to close soon. I created a backlog of to-dos for me to work through.
My hardware is definitely lacking right now, struggling to maintain my already lightweight server... hopefully I can upgrade this in the future... I wonder if that would be a hard/time consuming task.
The nextcloud software seems great so far. I love open source.
